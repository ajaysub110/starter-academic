      1. Deep learning to understand how spoken words are visually represented in the brain. Collected
      EEG data from human subjects listening to spoken audio of numerical digits, and employed deep
      generative models to construct images of digits purely from EEG signals.
      2. Review paper on the neural and psychological basis for reinforcement learning algorithms.
